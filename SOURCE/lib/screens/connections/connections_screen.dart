// Connections tab — per APP/Navigation/SEEKER NAVIGATION/Summary.md's
// CONNECTIONS section: "Relationship Journey = Save → Consider → Match
// → Conversation → Family Stage." Matches is NOT a conversation inbox
// (MATCH_UX_SPEC_CURRENT_VERSION_V1.md) — it houses Potential Journeys,
// with Active/Paused Journeys below leading into the Pre-Journey Ritual
// (JourneyFlowScreen) rather than straight to Chat.
//
// 2026-07-29 (Founder review — Connections-page redesign, Option 1 of 5
// presented in chat, chosen as-is): replaced the old flat
// MATCHES-then-everything layout with a two-panel "Journeys / Activity"
// segmented toggle (_SegmentedToggle, below).
//
// REVISED 2026-08-01 (Founder, screenshot review). Current layout:
//
//   Journeys   Active → Potential → Paused → Ended
//   Activity   Family Introductions → Considered → Saved → Passed
//
// Three changes and the reasoning, since the previous order was itself a
// deliberate decision and the comment describing it is now wrong:
//
//   1. POTENTIAL now precedes PAUSED. Potential Journeys are waiting on
//      you and are the most likely next action; Paused ones are, by
//      definition, not moving. Ordering by how live something is beats
//      ordering by lifecycle position.
//   2. ACTIVE JOURNEY is emphasised — full-white label, brighter card,
//      larger photo. Every header used to be identical white54, so the
//      one Journey you are actually in looked like everything else.
//   3. FAMILY INTRODUCTIONS moved to the top of Activity. It was placed
//      in Journeys on 2026-07-29 on the reasoning that a Family Stage is
//      part of a Journey's lifecycle. The Founder's read is better: the
//      Journeys tab answers "where are my Journeys up to" and every
//      other row there opens a Journey. An introduction between two
//      families is something that happened and wants attention — which
//      is Activity's job — and it outranks a bookmark, so it goes first.
//
// Activity rows use the same compact expansion language as Potential Journey:
// a persistent identity row, top-right Report flag, then profile, decision
// and compatibility actions. Journey rows use _JourneyExpandingCard.
// See _journeysChildren()/_activityChildren() for the two panels.
//
// 2026-07-26 (DR-ZYRA-101 audit, nav bar fix — see SEEKER NAVIGATION
// Summary.md's own flagged inconsistency: live Seeker nav had only 3
// tabs, Browse/Matches/Profile, with no Connections or Guardian tab at
// all). This screen used to be MatchesScreen (screens/matches/
// matches_screen.dart) and only covered the Matches section. Renamed
// and expanded to also surface Passed/Saved/Considered — reusing
// AppState.declined/saved/outgoingLikes exactly as profile_screen.dart
// already did for its own (now-superseded) connections counters — and
// a placeholder Family Introductions section, since the Guardian-side
// Family Stage answering UI is a known, deliberately unbuilt gap (see
// the Founder handover's "Immediate Next Steps" item 1) rather than
// something to fake here.
//
// 2026-07-25 (DR-ZYRA-101 audit): Matches section rewritten against
// real matches.status ('potential'/'active'/'ended') instead
// of the old client-only stand-in. "Start Journey" now calls
// ZyraJourneyService.promoteToActive (a real RPC enforcing
// one-Active-Journey-at-a-time), and both journey lists are re-fetched
// from the backend rather than mutated locally. A PAUSED JOURNEYS
// section surfaces paused journeys (Journey Suspension,
// JOURNEY_SUSPENSION (CURRENT_VERSION)) with Resume/End actions.

// 'dart:ui' import removed 2026-08-13: ImageFilter.blur was used only by
// the private _SegmentedToggle, which moved to
// widgets/zyra_segmented_toggle.dart in the same pass. Nothing in this
// file reaches into dart:ui any more.

// CHANGED 2026-08-01 (Founder: "when we choose Journey or Activity it's
// white but make it be the same as navigation bar please, transparent").
//
// Was a solid white fill with dark text — the only opaque surface on the
// screen, so it read as a different app's control sitting on ZYRA's
// gradient, and it fought the floating nav bar directly below it for
// attention.
//
// The values below are lifted from floating_nav_bar.dart rather than
// invented, so the two controls are literally the same material:
//
//   track     white 0.10, border white 0.18, blur 22   (the bar)
//   selected  white 0.28, border white 0.12            (the blob)
//
// If the nav bar's glass is ever retuned, retune this with it.
/// The three labels, in page order. Founder 2026-08-06.
///

//  added 2026-08-05 with Guardian Suggestions. It behaves like

// yourself — you didn't; your Guardian did.
/// ONE CARD METRIC FOR THE WHOLE APP — 2026-08-05 (Founder: "look at how
/// the cards are different sizes. I kinda want all cards to be the same for
/// a cleaner UI, this includes the Wali cards on the Wali tab").
///
/// Every list row that shows a person — Guardian Suggestions, Considered,
/// Saved, Passed, and the Guardian cards on the Wali tab — now uses these
/// three numbers. They were previously chosen per-widget: 52pt thumbnails
/// here, 56×64 on suggestions, 44 and 36 on the Wali tab, with padding of
/// 12, 13 and 16. Nothing was wrong individually; together they read as
/// four different design systems on four screens.
// ZyraCardMetrics MOVED to theme/zyra_card_metrics.dart — 2026-08-15
// (DR-ZYRA-171, audit UI-03). Four screens were importing THIS 4,000-line
// file to reach three constants; a design token lives in the theme. The
// doc comment travelled with it, values unchanged, and every former
// `show ZyraCardMetrics` importer now imports the theme file directly.

/// A profile thumbnail that survives a profile with no photos.
///
/// ADDED 2026-08-13 (DR-ZYRA-157) and it is the precondition for
/// everything else in that decision. `SeekerProfile.photoUrl` is
/// `photos.first` and THROWS on an empty list, and _ActivityCard called
/// it unguarded — collapsed thumb and expanded hero both. That is the
/// reason the Introductions card was built as its own widget on
/// 2026-08-05 rather than reusing this one: "_ActivityCard's photo fills
/// the row, so a profile without photos became a full-height grey
/// rectangle (the Founder's screenshot)".
///
/// Fixing the cause is what lets the two cards become one. It also
/// closes a latent crash that was only ever hidden by real profiles

/// built with `photos: const []`, and so is every counterpart card.

// introduction kind.
//
// ITS TWO REASONS FOR EXISTING, AND WHAT HAPPENED TO THEM. The class
// header argued both, on 2026-08-05:
//
//   VISUAL — "_ActivityCard's photo fills the row, so a profile without
//   photos became a full-height grey rectangle (the Founder's
//   screenshot)". TRUE AT THE TIME AND STILL TRUE THIS MORNING:
//   _ActivityCard called photoUrl (= photos.first) unguarded on the
//   thumb, and indexed photos[clamp(0, -1)] on the hero — the first
//   throws on an empty list, the second fails on the clamp. Both are
//   fixed now (_cardThumb, and the hero's own guard), which is what made
//   the merge safe rather than a re-run of that screenshot. The fix also
//   closes a latent crash that only ever stayed hidden because real
//   profiles happen to carry photos.
//
//   BEHAVIOURAL — the retired class once kept Introduction decisions off
//   the row. That is historical, not current product truth: every row now
//   uses the shared Activity decisions. Local test rows route those same
//   controls through ZyraDevScenario rather than production writes.
//
// Deleted rather than left unused — an unreferenced widget is one
// somebody re-adds a call to six weeks later without reading why it
// stopped being used.

/// THE ACTIVE JOURNEY CARD. Founder, 2026-08-10: "make that profile card much
/// larger with the bottom have 2 text, enter and view timeline in bubbles."
///
/// Replaces `_JourneyTile(emphasised: true)` for this one section. The
/// emphasised tile was carrying two jobs badly — it existed to answer the
/// 2026-08-01 note that "active journey should be more stand out then the
/// rest" by being a slightly brighter version of a list row, and a slightly
/// brighter list row is still a list row.
///
/// ZYRA allows ONE Active Journey at a time. It is not the first item in a
/// list; it is the thing the app is for, and the other three sections are
/// where the rest waits. So it gets its own shape: a 96px portrait, the name
/// at heading size, the stage underneath, and the two things you actually do
/// from here as pills across the bottom.
///
/// NO NEW ACCENT COLOUR, for the same reason the emphasised tile avoided one:
/// the gender gradient is already behind this card, and a third colour would
/// fight it. Emphasis is size, weight and white alpha only.
///
/// The pills use circular(20) and ZyraColors.iconButtonBg/Border — the app's
/// existing pill, unchanged, so this reads as the same product rather than a
/// new screen. The whole card stays tappable and goes where Enter goes; the
/// pill names the action rather than owning it.

// The takeover, INLINE — what a tap on "Begin" becomes when the plan's
// Active Journey cap is already full.
//
// A POPUP UNTIL 2026-08-12, EVENING. Founder picked B1 (one blocks) and
// C1 (several block) as glass dialogs earlier that same day, then — shown
// three presentations side by side in the interactive round (B1 the
// glass dialog, B2 the same dialog solid pink/purple, B3 the card itself
// extending) — chose the card: "point 4 do b3". Same parts, same words,
// same hierarchy as the dialogs; only the surface changed. Two knock-ons,
// both deliberate: the dialogs' tap-outside dismissal became a written
// "Not now" (a card extension has no outside), and the person's portrait
// shortens to a strip while the choice is open — the accepted cost of
// fitting the choice where the person already is.
//
// TWO shapes, one set of parts:
//
//   _InlineTakeover (B1's shape, of eleven mockups across three rounds)
//   — ONE Journey blocks. Both people at the top as circular photos
//   ("you're deciding about a person, not a slot"), a one-line body,
//   Continue as the hero out of respect to the active Journey — his
//   word: 'continue', never 'stay' — then Pause and End as square cards.
//
//   _InlineTakeoverChooser (C1's shape, over the two-step C2) — SEVERAL
//   block, which exists since plan_aware_active_journey_limit made ZYRA
//   One's cap of 3 real. The new person waits at the top; the active
//   people are tappable chips; the same square cards re-aim at whoever
//   is chosen and stay dim and inert until someone is.
//
// The avatar and the cards are top-level functions shared by both, so the
// two shapes cannot drift apart. The below-cap Begin confirm is STILL a
// dialog — it was never part of the B1/B2/B3 round.
//
// Three ways out, every one of them honest:
//   Continue / Not now  dismiss — nothing changes, and the caption says so
//   Request Pause  asks the current person; the waiting Journey cannot begin
//                  unless both agree and the Active slot is released
//   End       endJourney, then the promote; permanent, Timeline kept
