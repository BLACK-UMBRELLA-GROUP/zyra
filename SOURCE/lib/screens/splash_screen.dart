// Splash — the branded opening.
//
// CURRENT 2026-09-27: Founder selected Quiet Horizon as the main splash.
// The gold wordmark and quiet drawn horizon reuse the selected shared artwork;
// the canonical tagline, 2.4s motion and AuthGate callback stay. Founder
// 2026-09-30 first reduced the completed-frame hold from 2.0s to 1.25s,
// then reduced that still hold again to 0.65s. Motion remains 2.4s.
// Explicit legacy motions remain comparison-only. Earlier design notes below
// document their history and do not override this production choice.
//
// NEW 2026-08-07. The letters arrive one at a time and the tagline lands with
// the last of them. The final motion is now the Founder-approved Soft Bloom +
// Centre Draw (2026-08-26): warm light opens behind the name, then a short
// gold line grows evenly from its centre beneath the tagline. No travelling
// dot remains. Founder timing review later the same day slowed the motion from
// 2.0s to 2.4s while preserving a 1.0s final hold. Founder 2026-09-18 then
// asked for the complete splash to stay roughly one second longer, especially
// the gold line. Motion remains 2.4s; the finished composition now holds 2.0s.
//
// ── IT NOW ALWAYS PLAYS. Founder, 2026-08-07: "every time I open the app I
// want to start with the splash screen."
//
// That is a deliberate reversal of how this file worked an hour ago. The
// first version added ZERO time — it dressed up the wait AuthGate was
// already spending on the session lookup, and vanished the instant that
// finished, sometimes after 80ms. An animation cannot do that: cut it off
// mid-way and it reads as a glitch.
//
// So the splash now runs for [_total] and the app waits for it. The cost is
// real and it is a choice, bought for a first impression. If that ever feels
// too long, [_total] and [_animFraction] are the two timing controls — every
// visual interval below is expressed as a fraction of the motion phase.
//
// AuthGate holds the other half: it shows this until BOTH the animation has
// finished AND the session has resolved. On a slow network the profile
// fetch outlasts the animation and the last frame simply holds, which is
// why the composition ends in a state that is calm to sit in.
//
// ── THE NATIVE LAUNCH IMAGE MUST BE A FLAT COLOUR, and this is not
// optional. iOS and Android paint a static image before Flutter draws
// anything. If that image contains the wordmark — as it did until today —
// the user sees ZYRA fully assembled, then watches it vanish and rebuild
// itself letter by letter. flutter_native_splash is now configured with a
// colour and no image; assets/splash/splash_logo.png is no longer
// referenced. Do not put it back.
//
// ── GRADIENT. THE BRAND PURPLE, ALWAYS. Never gender-matched.
//
// The Founder-directed 2026-09-27 palette is Hulu-inspired deep purple
// #30203F → #160E20, shared by production, all twelve preview studies,
// navigation and both roles. Gender never changes this presentation.
//
// ── THIS REVERSES THE 2026-08-07 CHANGE, deliberately. Founder,
// 2026-08-08: "it's got the pink purple colour but it should be the purple
// colour."
//
// That earlier change made the splash gender-matched to kill a flash the
// Founder had reported as "a second of purple before it goes pink" — the
// splash painting neutral, then main.dart's gendered layer taking over
// underneath it. The diagnosis was right and the fix was aimed at the
// wrong half: it removed the flash by making the splash the WRONG COLOUR
// for the whole four seconds, rather than by softening the handoff.
//
// The handoff is now where it belongs — AuthGate cross-fades the splash
// into the resolved screen (see auth_gate.dart), so brand purple resolves
// into the member's own colour as a transition instead of a cut. The
// splash itself stays brand purple start to finish.
//
// If a flash ever reappears, fix it in AuthGate. Do not re-tint the splash.

/// ── HOW IT WORKS. Every interval below is expressed as a fraction of the
