// Match Notification — E1, THE moment (DR-ZYRA-147/148, 2026-08-13).
//
// Was a single fade-in per MATCH_UX_SPEC's "warm, calm, human" — right
// instinct, functional execution, and the Founder named it the single
// biggest gap in the transitional-moments audit: mutuality is the first
// two-sided fact in the product, and it deserved a MOMENT, not a screen.
//
// Now it speaks the ratified grammar via ZyraMomentScreen (embedded —
// this screen IS the route, so the actions run callbacks instead of
// popping a pushed moment): the pair leads, "You've both chosen each
// other" lands, then orientation — she waits in Potential Journeys, one
// person at a time, both families present. Tap-through everywhere, per
// the engine's rule.
//
// The old placeholder self-photo (picsum "you") died with the rewrite —
// the viewer's side is now the engine's honest frost "You" circle.
