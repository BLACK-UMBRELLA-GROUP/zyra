// FULL PROFILE — read-only, for someone you are already in a Journey with.
//
// Founder, 2026-08-10: "we need somewhere where the user can view full
// profile which doesn't take them to browse page.. but I want somewhere they
// can see full photo".
//
// WHY THIS IS A NEW SCREEN AND NOT A REUSE. Before today there was no way to
// look at another person's profile except Browse. "View profile" elsewhere in
// the app does not open a profile at all — it switches the shell to the Browse
// tab and parks the profile there (browse_screen.dart:399,
// connections_screen.dart:87). That is fine for a suggestion you are about to
// decide on, and wrong for someone you are mid-Journey with: Browse is the
// DECIDING surface, carrying Save / Consider / Pass. Sending a Seeker there to
// look at the person they are ALREADY in a Journey with offers them decisions
// they have already made, on a screen whose whole job is making them.
//
// So: no actions on this screen. It is a place to look, not to choose.
//
// AMENDED 2026-08-12 (Founder, Option A of the row-tap mockups: "the row
// IS the person… execute all of it"): the JOURNEY LIST rows now open this
// screen for Potential, Paused and Ended people, and those states carry
// their actions WITH them — an optional [actionBar] rendered at the foot,
// and an optional [stateLabel] chip at the top right. The screen itself
// stays action-agnostic: it renders what it is handed and never decides.
// The Journey header's own "Profile" pill passes neither, so mid-Journey
// viewing is exactly the no-actions place it always was. Browse remains
// the only deciding surface for people you are NOT yet matched with.
//
// PHOTO NAVIGATION MATCHES BROWSE — Founder, 2026-08-10. This was briefly a
// swipeable PageView with dots across the top, which is a second convention
// for the one gesture people use most in this app. Browse settled it long ago:
//   • TAP the left or right half to step back or forward
//   • a VERTICAL dot column on the LEFT edge, middle-aligned
//   • 7px dots, 3px apart, white when active, white32 when not, hairline
//     white30 border so they read on a pale photograph
// Copied to the pixel from browse_screen.dart's own indicator rather than
// approximated, because "nearly the same" is how two conventions start.
//
// WHAT IT CAN SHOW is bounded by SeekerProfile — id, firstName, surnameLine,
// age, city, photos, gender. No bio, occupation or education. Stated rather
// than padded with placeholders: an empty "About" section would imply the data
// exists and is missing, when it has never been modelled.
//
// PHOTO VISIBILITY IS ENFORCED SERVER-SIDE. profile_photos is filtered by
// zyra_can_view_profile, verified by impersonation on 2026-08-08. This screen
// renders what it was handed; it is not a gate and must never become one.
