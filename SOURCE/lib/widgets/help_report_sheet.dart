// Help/Report menu — dark-glass bottom sheet.
//
// PRESENTATION HISTORY, because this has moved five times and the reasons
// matter more than the moves:
//
//   1. anchored card from a top-right "..." icon
//   2. centred showDialog card, dark glass
//   3. bottom sheet in the solid brand gradient  (2026-07-27)
//   4. bottom sheet, dark translucent glass      (2026-07-27, 3rd pass)
//   5. bottom sheet, ratified gender gradient    (2026-08-01)
//   6. centred glass card                        (2026-08-01)
//   7. BOTTOM SHEET, RATIFIED SHEET GLASS        (2026-08-11, current)
//
// The file was `help_report_card.dart` / class `HelpReportCard` through
// stages 1–2 and was renamed at stage 3 to match what it had become. At
// stage 7 the name is accurate again.
//
// STAGE 7 (Founder, screenshot review of stage 6: "im 50/50 on it.
// theres somethign i dont like about it… lets see if it matches the
// general ui" — plus the approved Frost UI brief, Fable session
// 2026-08-11). What the 50/50 was, named: the centred card floats
// mid-screen ANCHORED TO NOTHING, directly over the person's face — and
// in this app every other small menu either hangs off the control that
// opened it (anchored_card_overlay.dart) or rises from a screen edge.
// An unanchored rectangle over a photo reads as system UI, not ZYRA.
//
// So: back to a bottom sheet — it rises from an edge, never covers the
// face, and keeps "closed by tapping anywhere else" via the barrier.
// NOT a return to stage 4/5's look, and the difference is the point:
//   - surface is ZyraColors.sheetSurface, the base RATIFIED for bottom
//     sheets app-wide in zyra_colors.dart's 2026-08-01 block ("a surface
//     anchored to the bottom of the screen… continuous with whatever
//     gradient is behind it"). Stage 5's gender gradient predated that
//     ratification; stage 4's dark glass was the unratified near-black.
//   - blur σ30 kept from stage 6, so the photo still reads through.
//
// The stage-6 glass recipe (white 14/22, radius 24, inset 36) remains
// the ratified language for CENTRED surfaces (zyra_glass_dialog.dart) —
// this is the edge-anchored counterpart, not a replacement for it.
//
// Opened from browse_screen.dart's long-press-centre gesture
// (_openHelpReportSheet, now showModalBottomSheet) — see that file's
// header for the gesture history, including why the hold is 300ms and
// not Flutter's default.
