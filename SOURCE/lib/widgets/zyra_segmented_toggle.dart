// The app's top segmented pill — frosted glass, a single sliding fill,
// labels that brighten and dim continuously with the gesture.
//
// EXTRACTED 2026-08-13 (Founder: "in Network section at top we have
// Discover and Requests but make it same as Seeker's Connections page top
// slider pill"). It lived as a private class inside connections_screen.dart
// with a hardcoded three-label list, so the Guardian side could not use it
// and had grown its own pair of plain rounded buttons instead — two
// controls doing one job, looking nothing alike.
//
// Nothing about the appearance or behaviour changed in the move. The only
// difference is that the labels are a parameter now, so the fill divides by
// however many there are.
//
// The design decisions it carries, all Founder-ratified and unchanged:
//
//  · A SLIDING FILL, not independently-tinted segments (2026-08-03). The
//    old version coloured whichever segment was selected, which cannot
//    render "60% of the way across". One box positioned by `position` can,
//    which is what lets it travel with a swipe instead of snapping at the
//    end of it.
//  · AN UNSEEN DOT, not a numbered badge (2026-08-06). The heading already
//    says how many; the dot only has to answer whether there is anything.
//    White, not lavender and not gold — white belongs to both gender
//    gradients equally, and gold already means PREMIUM in this app.
//  · THE DOT SITS IN THE ROW, not over it. The words nearly fill their
//    share of the width, so anything absolutely positioned lands on the
//    text. Laid out inline it cannot collide with anything.
