// THE NAME BLOCK — one definition, every surface that shows a person.
//
// DR-ZYRA-163, 2026-08-13 (Founder: "in Connections, in profile cards
// when there's the photo it says name, age and underneath location, but
// it's not matching the Browse design. Make it copy the Browse style.
// That applies to all profile views in Connections, in card format or
// full profile").
//
// ── WHY A WIDGET AND NOT A COPY OF BROWSE'S LAYOUT.
//
// The obvious reading of "make it copy the Browse style" is to go and
// retype Browse's block in three more places. That is what this session
// already did with the nav bar, four times, before DR-ZYRA-159 deleted
// the copy: a replica converges on the thing it copies and never
// arrives, because every later change to the original has to be noticed
// and mirrored by hand.
//
// The name block has already drifted exactly that way. Before this file
// there were four versions of one idea:
//
//   Browse            Arif Iqbal      /  36 · Derby
//   Full profile      Arif / Iqbal    /  36 · Derby      (surname own line)
//   Card hero         Arif, 36        /  📍 Derby        (comma, pin icon)
//   Journey hero      Arif, 36        /  📍 Derby        (same again)
//
// Nobody decided on four. They accumulated, because each was written
// where it was needed. One widget is the only version of "copy the
// Browse style" that is still true next month.
//
// ── THREE LINES: FIRST NAME · SURNAME · AGE · LOCATION.
//
// REVERTED 2026-08-13, same day (DR-ZYRA-164, Founder: "revert the name
// surname age area back to old design... line one first name, line 2
// middle surname, line 3 age dot location"). The one-line version
// (DR-ZYRA-162, option C of five) lasted a few hours on device.
//
// THE MIDDLE DOT SURVIVES THE REVERT, and it is the only part of that
// pass that does — "the only small difference is instead of | keep the
// centre dot separating age and location". So the layout goes back and
// the separator stays forward, which is a narrower change than either
// "revert it" or "keep it" on its own.
//
// The reversal costs nothing structural, and that is the point of the
// widget existing: one file changed, and Browse, the full profile and
// both Connections heroes all moved together. Before DR-ZYRA-163 this
// would have been four edits with four chances to leave one behind.
//
// ── PROPORTIONS, NOT SIZES.
//
// Callers pass ONE number, [nameSize]. The surname and the meta line are
// derived from it, so a block at 20pt is the same design as a block at
// 30pt rather than a second set of choices. The ratios are Browse's own
// (30 / 18 / 16).
//
// The meta line has a floor of 12pt. Pure ratio would put it at 10.7 on
// a card hero, which is below where this app lets secondary text go.
