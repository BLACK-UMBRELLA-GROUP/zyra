// Fades the top and bottom edges of a scrollable instead of cutting them.
//
// ADDED 2026-08-07, after four wrong diagnoses of the same complaint
// (Founder, repeatedly: "there's a line at the top… and a line at the bottom
// when I scroll down").
//
// WHAT IT ACTUALLY WAS. Screens using `extendBodyBehindAppBar: true` let
// content scroll UNDER a transparent app bar. Nothing hides the transition,
// so a widget passing the viewport edge is CUT — cleanly, in a straight
// horizontal line. On text it reads as a crop. On a solid shape like the
// Guardian monogram it reads as a hard rule across the screen, because half
// a circle with a flat top IS a line.
//
// Measuring the still image found no seam anywhere, twice, which is exactly
// what you would expect: the line is not painted, it is the ABSENCE of the
// pixels above it. That is why removing the refresh indicator, the Material
// 3 app-bar tint, the duplicated gradient and the overscroll indicator each
// fixed something real and none of them fixed this.
//
// THE FIX. A ShaderMask that ramps alpha from 0 to 1 over the first few
// points and back to 0 over the last few. Content dissolves into the
// gradient rather than meeting a boundary. Nothing is drawn — the mask
// removes pixels, so it cannot introduce a colour of its own, which is what
// made every earlier attempt at this fail on a gradient background.
