// Renders a profile photo, whether it is a real URL or a dev colour block.
//
// ADDED 2026-08-03 with the 200 colour-block test profiles (Founder: "just
// put black / blue / green solid colours etc to represent more than one
// photo").
//
// ONE place decides, deliberately. `Image.network` was called directly in
// six files; without this, adding colour support would have meant six
// copies of the same conditional and a seventh appearing the next time
// somebody rendered a photo. Every one of those call sites now goes
// through here, so a colour block works everywhere a photograph does —
// Browse, the Connections cards, Journey tiles, Chat headers, the Guardian
// views — without any of them knowing the concept exists.
//
// The error fallback is also unified. Three of those six call sites had a
// slightly different errorBuilder and two had none at all, so a broken
// image showed as a dark rectangle in some places and Flutter's grey
// broken-image glyph in others.

// ── THE SECOND LOADING SCREEN — fixed 2026-08-08.
//
// Founder, having just had the Material spinner removed everywhere else:
// "there's still a 2nd delay where the loading page with 4 dots switched to
// another loading page with moving circle."
//
// This file was it, and it was NOT on the list of screen-level loaders I
// migrated — I had classified it as an "image placeholder" and deliberately
// left it alone. That classification was wrong, and it was wrong for a
// reason worth writing down: I judged it by WHAT IT IS (a loadingBuilder on
// an Image) instead of BY HOW BIG IT RENDERS. The only call site that
// passes `showLoader: true` is the Browse card, where the photo is
// effectively the whole screen — so a 34px spinner centred in it is,
// from the user's seat, a full loading screen. Same event, same treatment.
//
// The size guard below is what that mistake should have been in the first
// place: the indicator now depends on the space it actually gets, not on
// which widget happens to own it.

          //      card keeps the member's gradient the whole way through.
          //
          //   2. The photo then appeared in one frame. AnimatedSwitcher
          //      cross-fades it in over the dots instead.
          //
          // Not frameBuilder, which is the usual way to fade an image in:
          // while loadingBuilder is showing the placeholder, the
          // frameBuilder subtree is not mounted, so its first build already
