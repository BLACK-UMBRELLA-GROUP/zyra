// The comet rule — two lights running toward each other along a hairline.
//
// Historical comet-rule implementation, retained for the Splash lab and
// for explicit legacy loading-style previews:
//
//   SPLASH   plays it once. The lights arrive, overlap, and fade, leaving
//            the rail under the wordmark for the still second at the end.
//   LOADING  used to play it on a loop. Founder-selected Meet and Pass
//            superseded that default on 2026-08-20.
//
// Extracted from splash_screen.dart on 2026-08-09 the moment the second
// caller appeared. This codebase has already paid for the alternative
// today: four private copies of the same age-fetching method meant one
// bug in four places and no guarantee a fix reached all of them (I3, "one
// path, or the paths will drift"). A second copy of an animation is the
// same trade with a prettier surface.
//
// ── WHAT REPLACED THE ORBS, AND WHY. Founder, 2026-08-08: "I just don't
// like the purple ball the pink and blue creates in end." Two soft discs
// meeting concentrically make a large area of a colour nobody chose —
// screen(#D4868F, #3D5A80) over the mid-gradient lands on ~#EBC7E1, a pale
// lilac. The merge was never the problem; the surface area was. Two lines
// meeting make the same colour across a few pixels.
//
// ── WHY BlendMode.screen. royalBlue (#3D5A80) is DARKER than the purple
// it sits on (~#644A74 mid-screen). Painted normally it is a muddy smear;
// screened it lifts to a light periwinkle and reads as light rather than
// ink. Measured, not guessed.
//
// RepaintBoundary is required, not decorative: backgroundBlendMode
// composites against whatever is already painted in the current layer, so
// each comet needs a layer to blend into.

///
/// The diagnosed glitch in [classic]: travel decelerates into 0.62 and a
/// UNIFORM opacity fade begins the same instant. On a gradient tail, a
/// uniform fade kills the faintest pixels first, so the visible line
/// appears to SHRINK BACK outward — motion nobody authored, read as the
/// lines "moving back the other way". Every variant below either removes
/// the uniform fade or gives the ending authored motion of its own.
/// All five keep the rail, the two comets, the palette and the timing
/// window; only the resolution differs. Previewed in the dev panel's
/// Splash lab and in a live side-by-side; the Founder chose PASS THROUGH
/// (2026-08-12), now SplashScreen's default. The loading loop keeps
/// [classic] — a loop never reaches an ending, so its uniform fade is
/// simply the reset between cycles and was never the glitch.
