// Fixed-order question bank for the Pre-Journey Ritual's three
// sustained phases and the Family Compatibility stage, per
// APP/Journey/PRE-JOURNEY RITUAL/Summary.md.
//
// NAMING, 2026-08-09: `phase1/2/3` here are STORAGE names and match
// matches.journey_stage's phase_1/phase_2/phase_3. What the member
// reads is Faith & Values, Building a Life and Navigating Life, and
// that lives in exactly one place — data/zyra_journey_stages.dart.
// Do not put a user-facing label in this file.
//
// DELIBERATE V1 SIMPLIFICATION (Founder decision, 2026-07-25): the
// spec calls for "Part A — AI-generated questions (adaptive)" that
// react to answer tensions and private ratings in real time. There is
// no LLM integration anywhere in this codebase, so this file stands
// in with a fixed, curated, hand-written question set per phase
// instead. Real AI-adaptive question selection (and Part B's
// searchable personal question library) is future work — out of
// scope for this pass.
