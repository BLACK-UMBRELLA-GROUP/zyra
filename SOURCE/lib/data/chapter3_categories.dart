// SEEKER ONBOARDING QUESTIONS/Questions Chapter 3 Your Values.md (Draft V2,
// 2026-06-28) — Q1-Q104. ch4Status per Chapter 3
// Classification — Ch4 Mapping.md (V3 Approved). This is the single
// source of data for both Chapter 3 (About You) and Chapter 4 (Your
// Preferences, auto-derived from every question with ch4Status != none).
// Founder direction on 2026-08-19 reorganises the unchanged bank into 11

// compatibility category and comes from Chapter 2 rather than being repeated.
//
// Q26 (Views on Polygamy) has two gender-conditional variants with
// different option lists, per spec — both share id 'ch3_q26'; only one
// is ever visible for a given user (genderVisibility handles this).
