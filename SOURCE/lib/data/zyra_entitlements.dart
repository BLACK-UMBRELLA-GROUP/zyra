// THE MATRIX
// ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
//
//                    Seeker Basic       Seeker One
//   Active                 1                  3
//   Potential             10              unlimited
//   Paused                 1                 10
//   Paused returns         0                  5
//   Ended returns          0                  5
//
// Basic restored by DR-ZYRA-252, 2026-10-03. Client capacity policy only;
// neither an enum nor this matrix proves a joining payment or grants access.
// Existing records survive. Server/receipt reconciliation remains separate.
//
// ── WHY A FILE AND NOT FOUR CONSTANTS. This project has paid three times
// today for the same mistake: four copies of an age fetch, two copies of
// a comet animation, three copies of a Journey stage switch. Limits are
// worse than labels, because a limit that disagrees with the server does
// not look wrong — it looks like the app refusing you for no reason.
//
// So: add a FIELD to [ZyraJourneyLimits], never a second table of numbers
// somewhere else. If a plan gains a fifth countable thing, it goes here.
//
// ── POTENTIAL IS NULLABLE, AND null MEANS UNLIMITED — not zero, and not
// "unknown". ZYRA One has no ceiling on Potential Journeys. Anything
// comparing against this must handle null explicitly; [isWithin] exists
// so that nobody writes `count < limit` against a null and gets it wrong.
//
// SERVER ENFORCEMENT
//
// Active caps have been server-enforced per plan since 2026-08-12. The
// shared Pause decision migration staged on 2026-08-25 made the capacity
// boundary explicit. Its previous Basic pause cap (5) is NOT migrated by
// this client's Founder revision to 1; server reconciliation is separate:
//
//   pause_requested / continue_requested  -> still Active capacity
//   paused / resume_requested             -> Paused capacity for both
//
// Paused capacity is checked for BOTH Seekers under the same locked state
// transition. The new Journey does not move to Paused, or release the Active
// slot, until a valid mutual outcome is accepted.
//
// STILL UNBUILT: [potential]'s cap-with-choice flow. Journey history is
// visible to every plan; paid entitlement controls only who may initiate a
// return and only within the five most recent rows of that state. Incoming
// requests remain actionable regardless of plan. The ended-return server path
// remains held under OA-ZYRA-156 until attempt-owned ritual state is complete.
