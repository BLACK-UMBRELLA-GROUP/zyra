// THE CANONICAL JOURNEY STAGE MODEL — one definition, every surface.
//
// Agreed with the Founder 2026-08-09 after working the wording through
// from the machine outwards rather than from a copy deck inwards.
//
// ── WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. Before it, three screens each carried their own
// switch over the same eight strings, and they had already drifted:
//
//   wali_journey_detail_screen  'Phase 1 — Foundations'
//   wali_dashboard_screen       'Phase 1'
//   connections_screen          did not show stages at all — it said
//                               'In the Pre-Journey Ritual' for seven of
//                               the eight, which is not even true: the
//                               Ritual is what turns a POTENTIAL Journey
//                               into an Active one, and all eight of these
//                               stages run while status is already
//                               'active'.
//
// A fourth copy was about to be written for the Connections subtitle. That
// is invariant I3 — "one path, or the paths will drift" — and this project
// has paid for ignoring it twice already today, in four copies of an
// age-fetch and two copies of a comet animation.
//
// ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
// THE NAMING PHILOSOPHY. Read this before adding or renaming a stage.
// ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
//
//   EVERY LABEL NAMES THE SUBJECT OF THE COUPLE'S ATTENTION AT THAT
//   MOMENT.
//
// Not what the software is doing. Not what the stage is "for". What the
// two of them are actually thinking about. Revealing their compatibility ·
// the Salam · their Guardians · faith and values · building a life ·
// navigating life · the two families · each other, freely.
//
// ── AND THE STAGES ARE NOT ALL ONE KIND OF THING, which is why an earlier
// attempt to force them all into "topic" or all into "purpose" kept
// producing one label that felt wrong:
//
//   THRESHOLD    a mutual act both parties must complete. Nothing is
//                discussed; it is a door. zyra_advance_stage() moves
//                these directly.
//   SUSTAINED    a subject worked through over days or weeks, with a
//                question set behind it and a Family Review at the end.
//                zyra_advance_stage() REFUSES these with
//                'gated_transition' — they go through open_family_review.
//   DESTINATION  the end of the sequence.
//
// ── THE GRAMMAR IS LOAD-BEARING. Thresholds and the destination are noun
// phrases; the two longest sustained phases are gerunds — "Building a
// Life", "Navigating Life". That is deliberate. A threshold is something
// you COMPLETE; a phase is something you DO OVER TIME. Flattening all
// eight into tidy noun phrases would hide a distinction the user can feel.
// If you add a stage, match the grammar of its kind.
//
// ── ONE KNOWN EXCEPTION, recorded rather than hidden: "Guardian Gate"
// names a mechanism, not a subject. It is kept because it is already
// approved and already on two screens, and because "gate" is honest that
// the Journey stops there.
//
// ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
// EXTENDING THIS
// ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
//
// Founder, 2026-08-09: "if we ever need icons, colours, descriptions,
// helper text, progress indicators or localisation, I'd rather extend this
// one shared definition than create separate mappings."
//
// So: add a FIELD to [ZyraJourneyStage], never a second map somewhere
// else. [icon] and [description] are deliberately absent rather than
// stubbed — nobody has designed them, and a null field that every screen
// null-checks is worse than a field that does not exist yet.
//
// Localisation, when it comes: [label] becomes a key and the lookup moves
// behind a delegate. Having one map is the precondition for that being a
// half-day change instead of a hunt.

/// What kind of thing a stage is. See the philosophy note above — this is
/// not decoration, it decides the grammar of the label and whether
/// zyra_advance_stage() can move it directly.
