// ONE place that asks the server for ages.
//
// ── WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. Founder, 2026-08-08: "the ages are showing as 0."
//
// Every age in the app was 0. The cause was a rule I added the same
// morning and a fact I asserted without checking.
//
//   ages_for() gained a 50-id cap (I10, anti-enumeration). The migration
//   comment read: "50 = Browse's page size, so every legitimate caller
//   fits."
//
//   Browse has no page size. fetchCandidates() has no .limit() at all — it
//   selects every active, complete, opposite-gender Seeker. Measured
//   2026-08-08: 72 candidates per gender. 72 > 50, so ages_for() raised
//   ages_for_batch_too_large on EVERY Browse load.
//
// The failure was then invisible, because all four callers had their own
// private copy of the same method ending in `catch (_) { return {}; }`,
// and every caller falls back to age 0 on an empty map. A hard server
// error surfaced as a plausible-looking number.
//
// ── SO THE CAP IS NOT THE BUG AND IS NOT BEING RAISED. Capping the batch
// is correct: a caller asking for 500 ages is enumerating the database.
// What was wrong is that the client sent one oversized request instead of
// paging, and then hid the refusal. Both are fixed here.
//
// ── AND WHY IT IS SHARED. There were FOUR copies of `_fetchAges` —
// discovery, match, journey, guardian suggestions — identical but for the
// debug string. That is invariant I3 ("one path, or the paths will
// drift"): one bug, four places to fix it, and no guarantee a future fix
// reaches all four. They now all delegate here.
