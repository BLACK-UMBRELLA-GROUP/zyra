// App Lock — Face ID / Touch ID / device passcode to open ZYRA.
//
// NEW 2026-08-07. Founder decision, overriding the review document's own
// hedging: "For ZYRA I think this becomes a selling point, not just a
// privacy option."
//
// WHY THIS MATTERS MORE HERE THAN ON A TYPICAL APP. Phones get handed
// around in families. A parent, a sibling or a spouse-to-be picking up an
// unlocked phone is not a rare scenario in this audience — it is a normal
// Tuesday. And what is on screen is not merely private, it is socially
// consequential: who you passed on, who you saved, what your Guardian said.
// The device passcode makes the PHONE private. Only this makes the APP
// private, and only the second is true when the phone is unlocked and on
// the kitchen table.
//
// ── THIS IS NOT A SECURITY BOUNDARY. Say it plainly, because designing it
// as one would make it worse. The data is protected by RLS and by the
// session token, not by this. Anyone with real device access and intent
// can get past it. It is a privacy screen against the person standing next
// to you, which is the actual threat, and it should never be described to
// a user as anything more.
//
// ── NO PIN, DELIBERATELY. The review document proposed "biometric with a
// 4-digit fallback". That was wrong and is not what was built. A PIN of our
// own would have to be stored somewhere, and the only local store this app
// has is SharedPreferences, which is plain text on disk (see
// zyra_local_prefs.dart's own warning). Storing a hash instead would work
// but invents a credential system to guard something that is not a security
// boundary in the first place.
//
// So `biometricOnly: false` — local_auth falls back to the DEVICE's own
// passcode when biometrics fail, are not enrolled, or are locked out. The
// fallback is stronger than any four digits we would have designed, it
// works on devices with no biometric hardware at all, and ZYRA stores no
// secret whatsoever. There is nothing here for an attacker to extract.
//
// ── THE ESCAPE HATCH IS REQUIRED, not a courtesy. Biometrics break: a
// cracked sensor, a wet thumb, a face that stopped matching, an OS update
// that lost the enrolment. Because this is not a security boundary, being
// permanently unable to open your own account would be an absurd outcome
// — so the lock screen always offers Sign out, which returns the user to
// Apple or Google. They lose nothing: the account lives on the server, and
// signing back in restores it. A lock you cannot escape is a bug, not a
// feature.

// widgets.dart, NOT foundation.dart. AppLifecycleState is a dart:ui type
// re-exported by widgets; foundation does not carry it, and the failure is
// a compile error rather than anything the static checker can see —
// tools/zyra_check.py validates imports and member names, not type
// resolution. widgets re-exports foundation, so ChangeNotifier and
// debugPrint still come along.
