// THE THREE FETCHES DISTINGUISH FAILURE FROM EMPTY — BUG-05 of the
// 2026-08-14 audit (OA-ZYRA-225 path 4, fixed 2026-08-15). Each used to
// return its empty shape on ANY error, so a network failure rendered
// "All caught up — No new notifications" (copy that is most misleading
// exactly when the person needs to retry) and zeroed a badge that was
// still earned. NULL now means "the fetch FAILED — keep what you had /
// show an error"; the empty shape means the server really said empty.
// Signed-out still returns the empty shape: no account genuinely has no
// notifications. The mark-read methods stay best-effort and silent —

  // SECTION DOTS — DR-ZYRA-154, 2026-08-13
  // ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
  //
  // Founder: "The notification dot is only a navigation indicator showing
  // that something requires attention in that section... The purpose of
  // the dot is navigation awareness, not individual notification
  // tracking."
  //
  // TWO SYSTEMS, ONE PIECE OF STATE. The dot and the Notifications tab
  // answer different questions — "is there anything over there?" versus
  // "what exactly happened?" — but both read `read_at`, and opening a
  // section marks its notifications read (Founder decision, 2026-08-13).
  //
  // The alternative was a second store: a per-section `last_seen_at` so
  // the dot could clear while the row stayed bold. That is a BOOKMARK
  // AGAINST TIME, and the Founder's own 2026-08-06 standard rules on it:
  // "if something seems to require a bookmark against time, you have
  // probably framed the problem incorrectly. Look for the item whose
  // state is unresolved instead." A bookmark is a fact about the
  // observer; `read_at` is a fact about the notification, and it cannot
  // disagree with what it describes because it IS what it describes.
  //
  // THE NOTIFICATIONS TAB IS THE ONE EXCEPTION, and it is principled
  // rather than convenient: everywhere else the dot points at something
  // ELSE, so arriving is proof enough of having seen it. In the tab the
  // notification IS the content, so opening the tab marks nothing — that
  // is what leaves Mark all read something to do.

  /// THE MAP. Every type the LIVE database permits, checked against
  /// notifications_type_check on 2026-08-13 rather than against the
  /// migrations in this repo — the repo knew seven types and the
  /// database holds ten (see OA-ZYRA-215). A type this map has not been
  /// taught returns null and shows no dot, which is the safe direction:
  /// a missing dot is a quiet miss, a wrong dot sends someone to the
  /// wrong screen.
  ///
  /// ENDINGS AND DECLINES ROUTE EXACTLY WHERE EVERYTHING ELSE DOES, and
  /// that is load-bearing rather than incidental. OA-ZYRA-161's first
  /// safety rule is that a safety ending must be worded IDENTICALLY to
  /// an ordinary one, and OA-ZYRA-159 merged decline and expiry into one
  /// type so the requester cannot tell them apart. A destination is a
  /// tell in exactly the way wording is: if `journey_ended` lit a
  /// different dot, the dot would announce what the words were careful
  /// not to. One section for all of them, structurally.
