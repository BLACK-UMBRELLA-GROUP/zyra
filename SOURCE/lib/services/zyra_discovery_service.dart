//
// Real other-Seeker accounts don't exist yet in this preview build —
// realistically only the Founder's own test account is signed in
// today. fetchCandidates() falls back to the existing mockProfiles
// pool whenever the real query returns nothing (not signed in, RLS
// denies, network error, or genuinely zero other real Seekers yet) —
// same graceful-mock-fallback pattern as chapter2_flow.dart's dev/
// no-auth photo path. This keeps Browse always testable while still
// being genuinely live: the moment a second real Seeker signs up and
// completes their profile, they appear for real, no code change
// needed.
//
// Decline is deliberately NOT persisted anywhere, per PROFILE
// DECISION SYSTEM/Summary.md ("no record, no notification") — only
// Save and Like write to the backend.
//
// Compatibility scoring (DR-ZYRA-079, PROPOSED but wired in per that
// DR's own stated next step — see the score_candidates() SECURITY
// DEFINER function, 20260726120200_compatibility_scoring_security_
// definer.sql) is now applied to real candidates: a candidate who
// fails one of the
// signed-in user's Hard Requirements is excluded outright, and the
// remaining candidates are silently ordered by score. The numeric
// score itself is never attached to SeekerProfile or exposed to the
// UI — MATCH_UX_SPEC_CURRENT_VERSION_V1.md / BROWSE_UX_SPEC_CURRENT_
// VERSION_V1.md are both explicit that Compatibility % is "not shown
// anywhere until Active Journey begins." Ordering candidates by an
// unseen score doesn't violate that display rule, but showing the
// number would — so it stays entirely inside this service.
