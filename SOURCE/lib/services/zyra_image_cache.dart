// The disk home for photo bytes — Phase 1 of the ratified On-Device
// Data & Performance Review (DR-ZYRA-169, Founder-approved 2026-08-15).
//
// WHY IT EXISTS. Photos live in a private bucket behind signed URLs, and
// every fetch re-signs — same bytes, different URL string. Flutter's
// image cache keys on the URL, so it missed on every refresh, and it is
// RAM-only, so every cold start re-downloaded the entire Browse deck
// (~290 paths on a full deck, per zyra_photo_service.dart's own
// history). This cache keys on [keyFor] — the URL with its token
// stripped — which is stable across re-signing, so the same photo is
// fetched from the network once per TTL window instead of once per
// glance.
//
// THE ONE RULE (from the review): a cached value may PAINT, never
// decide. Nothing here gates anything; it is bytes for pixels only.
//
// SELF-MANAGING, five ways — the Founder's requirement is that no user
// ever clears a cache by hand:
//   1. TTL      — stalePeriod 7 days, matching the signed-URL lifetime.
//   2. Size     — LRU cap of 500 objects, enforced by the cache manager;
//                 lives in the OS cache directory, which iOS excludes
//                 from iCloud backup and may purge under storage
//                 pressure. Both are features here, not risks.
//   3. Recovery — every operation is try/caught; any failure is a cache
//                 MISS answered by the network, never an error a person
//                 sees. Same rule ZyraLocalPrefs.init() follows.
//   4. Schema   — [_schemaVersion] against ZyraLocalPrefs; a mismatch
//                 after an app update wipes once at startup, so "clear
//                 data after updating" can never become user folklore.
//   5. Events   — sign-out and account deletion empty everything
//                 (zyra_auth.dart calls [clearForSignOut]); blocking a
//                 user evicts their photos immediately (browse_screen's
//                 block path calls [evictUrls]); changing your own
//                 photos self-invalidates, because every upload mints a
//                 new storage path and therefore a new key.
//
// WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT HERE: signed URLs on disk (a signed URL is a
// bearer capability — the session memo for those is in-memory in
// zyra_photo_service.dart), structured profile data of any kind, and
// any notion of "clear cache" in Settings.
