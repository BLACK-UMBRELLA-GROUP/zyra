// Compatibility Unlock persistence.
//
// Founder approved 2026-08-03:
//   "A profile may only be Compatibility Unlocked once per user. Once
//    unlocked, the compatibility remains permanently accessible to that
//    user. Returning to the same profile must never consume another
//    Compatibility Unlock. The action button should permanently change
//    from Compatibility Unlock to View Compatibility after the initial
//    unlock."
//
// RENAMED FROM "Profile Unlock" in the same decision. The old pairing —
// `Profile Unlock` leading to `View Compatibility` — implied two different
// features. `Compatibility Unlock` → `View Compatibility` is one idea
// stated twice.
//
// WHAT IS REAL HERE AND WHAT IS NOT:
//
//   REAL   The unlock record. `profile_unlocks` rows are written and read,
//          RLS-scoped to the caller, with a unique index enforcing
//          once-per-profile-per-tier in the database rather than trusting
//          this class to check first.
//
//   NOT    The payment. There is no payment SDK in the project — verified
//          against pubspec.yaml: no in_app_purchase, no StoreKit, no
//          RevenueCat, no Stripe. The RPC still spends ledger credits; this
//          class never treats a missing checkout as a free live unlock.
//
//   REAL   The overall compatibility score, read by the presentation layer
//          from score_candidates().
//
//   NOT    Per-category compatibility totals. Until the server owns and
//          returns that contract, a new Compatibility Unlock+ is unavailable
//          and this service refuses it before any local or RPC write path.
