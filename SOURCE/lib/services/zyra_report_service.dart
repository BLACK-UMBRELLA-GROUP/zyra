// Reporting and blocking — 2026-08-01 (Founder request).
//
// Backed by profile_reports and profile_blocks (migrations
// profile_reports_and_blocks + fix_block_mutual_hide_rls_recursion).
// Before this, ZYRA had no way to report or block anyone at all: the
// Browse long-press menu's "Report a Problem" opened the generic Help &
// Support screen, with no subject and nowhere for a report to go.
//
// TWO DISTINCT ACTIONS, deliberately kept separate — the single most
// useful thing taken from the Muzz teardown (MUZZ_TEARDOWN_CURRENT_
// VERSION_V1.md §1.3). Muzz's reason list leads with "I don't want to see
// this person", which is a BLOCK, not a report. Most people reaching for
// "report" only want the person gone. Conflating the two floods the
// moderation queue with non-incidents and makes the user wait for a
// review they never needed.
//
//   block()  -> mutual invisibility, instant, no moderation involvement
//   report() -> goes to a moderation queue, permanent, not retractable
//
// A report ALSO blocks by default (reportAndBlock) — nobody who has just
// reported someone for harassment wants to keep seeing them while the
// report is reviewed.
//
// Blocking is enforced in profiles_select's RLS, not here, so it applies
// to every query path — Browse, Matches, Journey, chat participant
// lookups — including ones not written yet. This service only writes the
// rows; it is not where the rule lives.
