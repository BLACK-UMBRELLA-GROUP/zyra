// Guardian Suggestions — profiles a Seeker's Guardian has put forward.
//
// Backs the Connections › Activity section renamed from "Family
// Introductions" on 2026-08-05 (Founder: "it shouldn't be family
// introductions so it seems like you're already matched — I reckon family
// or guardian suggestions"). "Family Introductions" named the Family Stage
// of an active Journey; sitting above Considered and Saved it implied a
// match had already happened.
//
// The `wali_suggestions` table has existed since the initial schema and has
// never been read by anything. Its RLS already lets a Seeker select their
// own rows (`wali_suggestions_select`: wali_id = me OR seeker_id = me), so
// this needs no new policy and no SECURITY DEFINER function — the suggested
// profiles themselves come through the same `profiles_select` Browse uses.
//
// The Guardian-side UI for CREATING a suggestion is still unbuilt. Seeded
// server rows may still exist, but the visual developer control now uses
// deterministic local-only cards so testing this read path never mutates the
// signed-in account. Nothing here is dev-only: the read path is the real one
// and will keep working unchanged the day a Guardian can suggest for real.
